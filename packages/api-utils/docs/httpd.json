[["version", 4], ["markdown", "Provides an HTTP server written in JavaScript for the Mozilla platform, which \ncan be used in unit tests.\n\nThe most basic usage is:\n\n    var {startServerAsync} = require(\"httpd\");\n    var srv = startServerAsync(port, basePath);\n    require(\"unload\").when(function cleanup() {\n      srv.stop(function() { // you should continue execution from this point.\n      })\n    });\n\nThis starts a server in background (assuming you're running this code in an \napplication that has an event loop, such as Firefox). The server listens at \nhttp://localhost:port/ and serves files from the specified directory. You \ncan serve static content or use SJS scripts, as described in documentation \non developer.mozilla.org.\n\nYou can also use `nsHttpServer` to start the server manually:\n\n    var {nsHttpServer} = require(\"httpd\");\n    var srv = new nsHttpServer();\n    // further documentation on developer.mozilla.org\n\nSee \n[HTTP server for unit tests](https://developer.mozilla.org/En/HTTP_server_for_unit_tests)\nfor general information.\n"]]
